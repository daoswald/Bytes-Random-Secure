Revision history for Bytes-Random-Secure

0.02    Monday   September 17, 2012 16:22 PDT
    - Removed Math::Random::Secure dependency.
    - Added Math::Random::ISAAC and Crypt::Random::Source dependencies (they
      were already dependencies of Math::Random::Secure, so we're actually a
      little lighter-weight now).
    - POD enhancements: Explain Math::Random::ISAAC::XS plugin, explain
      dependency chain, and explain why it gets a whole lot worse under Windows.
