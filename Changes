Revision history for Bytes::Random::Secure

0.10 2012-12-05
  - Fixed a few issues where v0.10 broke compatibility with Perls older than
    v5.10. (Removed // operator.)
  - POD improvements.
  - Added a few entries in MANIFEST.SKIP.
  
0.10 2012-12-04
  - Better handling of random_bytes() (no parameter passed): Now defaults to
    zero bytes explicitly, so we don't get "uninitialized values" warnings.
  - Added random_string_from($bag,$length) function.
  - Added tests for no param list, as well as for new random_string_from()
    function and its support functions.
  - POD enhancements.
  - Removed bytes pragma; it wasn't necessary, and prevented support for
    unicode code points in random_string_from()'s bag.

0.09 2012-11-02
  - "Changes" is now CPAN::Changes::Spec compliant.
  - Added t/09-changes.t to verify spec compliance.

0.08 2012-10-28
  - Added an example in the ./examples/ directory.
  - Added a minimum Perl version to the distribution metadata.

0.07 2012-09-23
  - Refined t/20-functionality.t's approach toward verifying bytes seem well
    behaved.
  - Corrected a couple of POD problems.
  - Note: Under Moose the test suite generates a few warnings.  Not sure what
    the best solution will be (they're harmless but annoying).

0.06 2012-09-21
  - Fixed the optionality of t/21-bytes_random_tests.t.
  - Documented the install process in README.

0.05 2012-09-20
  - POD revisions: Better details on dependencies, minimizing bloat, and 
    Win32-specific requirements.
  - 21-bytes_random_tests.t is now optional, because Statistics::Basic will 
    fail to install in some environments due to a problem in one of its 
    dependencies (Number::Format).

0.04 2012-09-19
  - Added t/21-bytes_random_tests.t, which is an adaptation of the test suite
    for the Bytes::Random module.
  - Added a BUILD_REQUIRES dependency to accommodate the Bytes::Random tests.

0.03 2012-09-18
  - POD enhancements, explaining the dependency chain, and how to minimize
    the Any::Moose impact by ensuring Mouse is installed.
  - Removed syntax that was only valid for newer versions of Perl.  We should
    be 5.6.x compatible now.
  - Placed the random number factory in a closure, making it only accessable
    by the accessor random_bytes().
  - Added some tests for seed generation since we took that functionality 
    away from Math::Random::Secure when we removed it from our list of
    dependencies in v0.02.
  - Added a Win32 test to Makefile.PL so that a Windows-only dependency will
    be included if necessary.

0.02 2012-09-17
  - Removed Math::Random::Secure dependency.
  - Added Math::Random::ISAAC and Crypt::Random::Source dependencies (they
    were already dependencies of Math::Random::Secure, so we're actually a
    little lighter-weight now).
  - POD enhancements: Explain Math::Random::ISAAC::XS plugin, explain
    dependency chain, and explain why it gets a whole lot worse under Windows.

0.01 2012-09-06
  - Initial CPAN release.
