Revision history for Bytes-Random-Secure
0.07    Sunday September 23, 2012 22:48 PDT
    - Refined t/20-functionality.t's approach toward verifying bytes seem well
      behaved.
    - Corrected a couple of POD problems.
    - Note: Under Moose the test suite generates a few warnings.  Not sure what
      the best solution will be (they're harmless but annoying).
0.06    Friday September 21, 2012 22:43 PDT
    - Fixed the optionality of t/21-bytes_random_tests.t.
    - Documented the install process in README.
0.05    Friday September 21, 2012 13:15 PDT
    - POD revisions: Better details on dependencies, minimizing bloat, and 
      Win32-specific requirements.
    - 21-bytes_random_tests.t is now optional, because Statistics::Basic will 
      fail to install in some environments due to a problem in one of its 
      dependencies (Number::Format).
0.04    Wednesday September 19, 2012 15:00 PDT
    - Added t/21-bytes_random_tests.t, which is an adaptation of the test suite
      for the Bytes::Random module.
    - Added a BUILD_REQUIRES dependency to accommodate the Bytes::Random tests.
0.03    Tuesday  September 18, 2012 14:17 PDT
    - POD enhancements, explaining the dependency chain, and how to minimize
      the Any::Moose impact by ensuring Mouse is installed.
    - Removed syntax that was only valid for newer versions of Perl.  We should
      be 5.6.x compatible now.
    - Placed the random number factory in a closure, making it only accessable
      by the accessor random_bytes().
    - Added some tests for seed generation since we took that functionality 
      away from Math::Random::Secure when we removed it from our list of
      dependencies in v0.02.
    - Added a Win32 test to Makefile.PL so that a Windows-only dependency will
      be included if necessary.

0.02    Monday   September 17, 2012 16:22 PDT
    - Removed Math::Random::Secure dependency.
    - Added Math::Random::ISAAC and Crypt::Random::Source dependencies (they
      were already dependencies of Math::Random::Secure, so we're actually a
      little lighter-weight now).
    - POD enhancements: Explain Math::Random::ISAAC::XS plugin, explain
      dependency chain, and explain why it gets a whole lot worse under Windows.

0.01    Thursday September 6,  2012 15:43 PDT
    - Initial CPAN release.
