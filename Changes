Revision history for Bytes-Random-Secure

0.03    Tuesday  September 18, 2012 14:17 PDT
    - POD enhancements, explaining the dependency chain, and how to minimize
      the Any::Moose impact by ensuring Mouse is installed.
    - Removed syntax that was only valid for newer versions of Perl.  We should
      be 5.6.x compatible now.
    - Placed the random number factory in a closure, making it only accessable
      by the accessor random_bytes().
    - Added some tests for seed generation since we took that functionality 
      away from Math::Random::Secure when we removed it from our list of
      dependencies in v0.02.
    - Added a Win32 test to Makefile.PL so that a Windows-only dependency will
      be included if necessary.

0.02    Monday   September 17, 2012 16:22 PDT
    - Removed Math::Random::Secure dependency.
    - Added Math::Random::ISAAC and Crypt::Random::Source dependencies (they
      were already dependencies of Math::Random::Secure, so we're actually a
      little lighter-weight now).
    - POD enhancements: Explain Math::Random::ISAAC::XS plugin, explain
      dependency chain, and explain why it gets a whole lot worse under Windows.
