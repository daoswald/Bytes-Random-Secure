Bytes::Random::Secure

Generate strings of cryptographic-quality pseudo-random bytes as a string of
raw bytes, hex digits, MIME Base64, or MIME QuotedPrintable.


CONFIGURATION

Unless you really want to use Moose, please ensure that Mouse is available on
your system.  If it isn't, Any::Moose will pull in the heavy-weight: Moose,
which is overkill for what this module does.  In fact, the Mouse dependency
traces back to this module's seed generator: Crypt::Random::Source.

If you need better performance, install Math::Random::ISAAC::XS.  It will
be automatically detected, and will provide better performance as you generate
random bytes.

If you're on Windows, I'm sorry to say that there is an additional dependency
that will be pulled in automatically, and it's not light-weight.  Unfortunately
it's difficult to get a good random seed source in a Windows environment.  At
least it *does* work!  This dependency is Crypt::Random::Source::Strong::Win32.

On *some* Win32 systems it may be necessary to force the installation of
Crypt::Random::Source::Strong::Win32 prior to installing Bytes::Random::Secure,
due to a broken test in one of C::R::S::S::Win32's dependencies.
