Bytes::Random::Secure

Generate strings of cryptographic-quality pseudo-random bytes as a string of
raw bytes, hex digits, MIME Base64, or MIME QuotedPrintable.


CONFIGURATION

Please ensure that Mouse is available on your system.  If it isn't, Any::Moose
will pull in the heavy-weight: Moose, which is overkill for what this module
does.  In fact, the Mouse dependency traces back to this module's seed
generator: Crypt::Random::Source.

If you need better performance, install Math::Random::ISAAC::XS.  It will
be automatically detected, and will provide better performance as you generate
random bytes.

If you're on Windows, I'm sorry to say that there is an additional dependency
that will be pulled in automatically, and it's not light-weight.  Unfortunately
it's difficult to get a good random seed source in a Windows environment.  At
least it *does* work!
