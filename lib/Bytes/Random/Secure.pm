=head1 NAME

Bytes::Random::Secure - Perl extension to generate cryptographically-secure
random bytes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bytes::Random::Secure qw(
        random_bytes random_bytes_base64 random_bytes_hex
    );

    my $bytes = random_bytes(32); # A string of 32 random bytes.
    
    my $bytes_as_base64 = random_bytes_base64(57);

    my $bytes_as_hex = random_bytes_hex(8);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Bytes::Random::Secure> provides three functions that can be used anytime you
need a string (or MIME Base64 representation, or hex-digits representation) of
a specific number of random bytes.

This module can be a drop-in replacement for L<Bytes::Random>, with the primary
enhancement of using a much higher quality random number generator to create
the random data.  The random number generator comes from
L<Math::Random::Secure>, and is suitable for cryptographic purposes, including
the generation of random salt or random secrets.

In addition to providing C<random_bytes()>, this module also provides two
functions not found in L<Bytes::Random>: C<random_bytes_base64()>, and
C<random_bytes_hex>.

=head1 RATIONALE

This author can't begin to guess where others might use this module.  But this
author has found it useful for the following situations:

=over 4

=item * Generating random salt to be hashed along with passphrases (and stored
alongside them) to prevent rainbow table attacks.

=item * Generating a secret that can be hashed along with a cookie's session
content to prevent cookie forgeries.

=item * Generating raw cryptographic-quality pseudo-random data sets for testing
or sampling.

=head1 EXPORTS

By default C<random_bytes> is the only function exported.  Optionally
C<random_bytes_base64> and C<random_bytes_hex> may be exported.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 random_bytes( $number_of_bytes )

Returns a string containing as many random bytes as requested.

=head2 random_bytes_base64

    my $random_bytes_b64 = random_bytes_base64( $num_bytes );
    my $random_bytes_b64_formatted = random_bytes_base64( $num_bytes, $eol );

Returns a MIME Base64 encoding of the string of $number_of_bytes random bytes.
Note, it should be obvious, but is worth mentioning that a base64 encoding of
base256 data requires more digits to represent the bytes requested.  The actual
number of digits required, including padding is C<4(n/3)>.
Furthermore, the Base64 standard is to add padding to the end of any string for
which C<length % 57> is a non-zero value.

If an C<$eol> is specified, the character(s) specified will be used as line
delimiters after every 76th character.  The default is C<qq{\n}>.  If you wish
to eliminate line-break insertions, specify an empty string: C<q{}>.

=head2 random_bytes_hex( $number_of_bytes )

Returns a string of hex digits representing the string of $number_of_bytes
random bytes.

Again, it should be obvious, but is worth mentioning that a hex (base16)
representation of base256 data requires two digits for every byte requested.
So C<length( random_bytes_hex( 16 ) )> will return 32, as it takes 32 hex digits
to represent 16 bytes.  Simple stuff, but better to mention it now than forget
and set a database field that's too narrow.

=head2 random_bytes_qp

    my $random_bytes_qp = random_bytes_qp( $num_bytes );
    my $random_bytes_qp_formatted = random_bytes_qp( $num_bytes, $eol );

Produces a string of C<$num_bytes> random bytes, using MIME Quoted Printable
encoding (as produced by L<MIME::QuotedPrint>'s C<encode_qp> function.  The
default configuration uses C<\n> as a line break after every 76 characters, and
the "binmode" setting is used to guarantee a lossless round trip.  If no line
break is wanted, pass an empty string as C<$eol>.
